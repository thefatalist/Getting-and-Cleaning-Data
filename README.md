# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data

### This repository contains files for Getting and Cleaning Data ###

You should have "UCI HAR Dataset" foldler in the same directory with the "run_analysis.R" script.

Just execute "run_analysis.R", it takes no parameters. As a result it will create "tidy_data.txt" file in the same folder.
